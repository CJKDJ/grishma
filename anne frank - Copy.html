<p> Anne Frank?s diary needs no introduction. This beautifully written memoir of a young girl caught in the middle of one of the most horrific periods of human history, is a testament to the indestructible human will to persevere and survive in the face of the most adverse of circumstances. Where Anne Frank herself became one of the victims of the Second World War, her words, crowding every available inch of space in her diary, survived to keep her story and her memory alive for the rest of the world through the ages. . .
